# HL2DM Community Patch Config
A collection of optimisation, gameplay tweaks, and config fixes for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. 

This was originally part of the [Deathmatch Core Redux](https://github.com/Xeogin/xeogin.github.io) project by Xeogin. This reposity was made to split the client (player-related) files away from the server-related ones, making it easier to understand for users.

## Installation instructions
Drag and drop this into your Half-Life 2: Deathmatch directory; by default `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2 Deathmatch\`

## Changing Settings
`autoexec.cfg` - The only time you should touch this is to update the Community Patch. This is the first config file the game loads. 

`preferences.cfg` - Put your preferences here. As this is ran after the Community Patch, you won't need to re-download `autoexec.cfg` every time you want to revert settings.

### Examples of preferences.cfg (formerly overrides.cfg):
* [Xeogin's](https://github.com/Xeogin/HL2DM-Community-Patch-Config/blob/main/Half-Life%202%20Deathmatch/hl2mp/cfg/xeogin_preferences.cfg)
* [CLANG-CLANG's](https://github.com/ClangClangBattarang/ClangClang-HL2DM-Config/blob/main/Half-Life%202%20Deathmatch/hl2mp/cfg/overrides.cfg)

## Further Customisation
More customisation settings and suggestions are found on in this reposity's [Wiki](https://github.com/Xeogin/HL2DM-Community-Patch-Config/wiki).
