# HL2DM Community Patch Config
An optimised collection of tweaks and fixes for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch multiplayer. 

This is a project originally created by Xeogin, as part of (Deathmatch Core Redux)[https://github.com/Xeogin/xeogin.github.io]. However, this focuses on the game as a client, not as a server.

## Installation instructions
Drag and drop this into your Half-Life 2: Deathmatch configuration direction; by default `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2 Deathmatch\hl2mp\cfg`

## Changing Settings
`autoexec.cfg` - The only time you should touch this is to update the Community Patch. This is the first config file the game loads. 
`overrides.cfg` - Put your preferences here. As this is ran after the Community Patch, you won't need to re-download `autoexec.cfg` every time you want to revert settings.

Examples of overrides.cfg
