//The filename and location you place this file is important. Locate your Steam directory, then navigate to steamapps\common\Half-Life 2 Deathmatch\hl2mp\cfg\ then make sure the file is named autoexec.cfg. If you're using Windows and the settings don't load, make sure common file extensions aren't being hidden, as it's possible the file was saved as autoexec.cfg.txt by mistake.
